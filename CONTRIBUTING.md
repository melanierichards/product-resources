The [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all contributions (PRs, issues, comments, etc).

## Workflow

The intent of this project is to track product management resources that are personally useful to me. I’m aiming for resources that I know pretty well, vs going for a long, exhaustive list. Therefore, I’d prefer that suggestions be filed as issues rather than PRs. Even if I don’t add every suggestion, they can still be available to the community via open issues.

You are also welcome to fork this project and add or remove resources to your heart’s content!

Thank you for contributing!
